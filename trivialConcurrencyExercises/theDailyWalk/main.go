// Exercise 1: The Daily Walk.
// Every morning, Alice and Bob go for a walk.
// They both grab sunglasses, perhaps a belt, closing open windows, turning off ceiling fans,
// and pocketing their phones and keys.
// Once they're BOTH ready, which typically takes between 60 - 90 seconds,
// they arm the alarm, which has a 60 second delay.
// While the alarm counts down they both put on their shoes (35 - 45 seconds).
// They then leave the house together and lock the door before the alarm has finished the countdown.
